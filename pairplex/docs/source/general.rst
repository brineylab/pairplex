PairPlex: High-throughput native pairing of antibody heavy and light chains
===========================================================================

General Considerations
-------------------

PairPlex is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing users to customize the pairing process to their specific needs. The software is designed to work with a variety of sequencing platforms and can handle large datasets efficiently. PairPlex is also designed to work out of the box with the AIRR community's data standards, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows. We have paid extra attention to extensively test the different thresholds and parameters used in the pairing process, ensuring that the software is robust and reliable.

Nevertheless, the amount of data generated by high-throughput sequencing is overwhelming, and processing it takes time (and a decent amount of computing capacity). In test runs, PaiPlex has been benchmarked. Here are some runtimes for different datasets and parameters that will help estimate the needs for you own data:
 - Runtest 1:
    * 1 million B cells, split in 96 wells (~10,000 cells per well)
    * Undersequencing: 100,000,000 reads (NextSeq P1 2 x 300bp)
    * Min UMIs = 2, min reads = 3
    * Clustering threshold = 0.0
    * Runtime: 48h

- Runtest 2:
    * 250,000 B cells, split in 24 wells (~10,000 cells per well)
    * Oversequencing: 1,400,000,000 reads (NextSeq P3 2 x 300bp)
    * Min UMIs = 2, min reads = 3
    * Clustering threshold = 0.0
    * Runtime: 24h

All these tests were run on a single VM with 256 cores and 1TB of RAM. The runtime will depend on the number of cells, the number of reads, the clustering threshold, and the minimum number of reads and UMIs required to form a cluster. The memory footprint of PairPlex is relatively constrained and should not exceed 300 Go of RAM for the largest datasets.


Cost
-------------------

All in all, between sequencing costs and 10X Genomics reagents, the cost per paired antibody sequence drops to about 0.007 USD. This is a significant reduction compared to the cost of traditional methods, which can be several times higher. In comparison, the cost of traditional methods can range from 0.05 to 0.10 USD per sequence, depending on the specific method used and the scale of the project.
